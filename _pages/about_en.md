<h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>

I am Taiga Nakamoto, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Physics, Graduate School of Science, The University of Tokyo (Tsuji Group). My research interest is theoretical condensed matter physics, particularly the interaction between light and matter.

The interaction between light and electrons in matter is one of the most fundamental interactions in nature, and can be seen in every aspect of our lives, from the reflection/absorption of light to the laser oscillation and solar cells. Moreover, understanding the light-matter interaction has led to the development of many academic and technological fields, such as optoelectronics and photonics. In addition, in the field of quantum information science, which has attracted much attention in recent years, the light-matter interaction plays an important role as a basis for quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing.

From this background, I am interested in studying new phenomena and functions that can be achieved by controlling matter with light and controlling light with matter. In particular, I aim to understand the quantum interaction between particles such as electrons and nuclei that obey quantum mechanics and light at a microscopic level, and to gain new insights that contribute to the development of quantum information science and quantum information devices.
